# TODO List

- Move the particle addition to the table to the particle handler. Aka just call :new() and shoudl handle everything
- Add a way to weight the helper.random() to define weight for certain elements
- Add a function so I can call add_particles(parameters, number_of_particles)
- figure out why I was tripping with comments
